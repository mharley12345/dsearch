### Decentralized Search Engine Built on IPFS ###

## Search engine client build in react and node js.
## Uses the ipfs-search api for now while i build a crawler. Saves data to local storage while the client is connect once the client disconnects the cache is cleared . Keeps records of key words and maps the key word to the CID hash. That record is stored in the DHT for use on every node in the network.
